   <p><span style="color: brown">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the
      Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on
      rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have
      gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
   <p>I've started putting up a <a href="Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the
      production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.
      If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please 
      contact me.</p>
   <p>Once again: <span style="color:brown"><i>BRAVO!!!</i></span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
