       <h2>Features</h2>

   <p>Smooth Smith Action: The bar (rated at 800 lb. capacity) slides on Teflon bushings
        alongside solid steel guide rods. Smooth motion is key to successful workouts,
        as the target muscles are utilized to their full potential with each repetition.</p>

    <p>Proper Angle: The bar travels along a 7 degree path from vertical. Studies have
        shown that this is the proper lifting angle to increase your comfort and
        prevent injury.</p>
    <p>Safety: The LSM400 has 20 lock-out points for a safe, solid stop at 
        any point in your workout routine.</p>
    <p>Rugged: Constructed with heavy 12 gauge steel and 7 gauge reinforcing plate. This is
        a unit built to last.</p>
    <p>Warranty: Every part of the LSM400 has a lifetime guarantee. We will replace
        or repair anything that goes wrong</p>
